    At NYU, I studied advanced mathematics in *real analysis, linear algebra, probability, ODEs*, etc. Though the
    classes were challenging for me, I had a better understanding in mathematics. More importantly, I passed the qualifcation exam for
    masters students (also know as Written Exams)!

    I took a machine learning course in my last semester. During the class, I conducted a research project about interpretability/explainability
    of ML. I found myself enjoy studying ML and doing ML research. I'm looking for graduate programs that allow me to dive deep into ML.

    At UC Irvine, I found my interests in applied mathematics. I
    participated several undegraduate research and won a few fellowships for my research opportunities.

    Awards/Fellowships/Grants:
    - Pi Mu Epsilon
      2016 - 2017
    - Physical Science Summer Research Program (PHY7) Award
      2016
    - Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) Scholarship Award
      2015

    Besides from doing research, I actively engaged in the campus by joining the *Math Club* as *Treasurer* and
    *ASUCI* (student government) as an intern.
