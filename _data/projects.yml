  description: |
    - Developed logistic growth model of *C. Trachomatis* to find optimal conversion rate and switch point
      between *C. Trachomatis* states
    - Applied calculus of variations to find critical points in the transition between *C. Trachomatis* states
    - Computed conversion rate of *C. Trachomatis* applying numerical methods in MATLAB
    - Verified optimal conversion rate existence is dependent on the optimal switch point
